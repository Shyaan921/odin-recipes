        <li>When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove casserole from the refrigerator and uncover. Whisk condensed soup and remaining 1/2 cup milk together in a bowl; pour mixture over casserole.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until firm and golden brown, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
